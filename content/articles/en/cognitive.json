Situation Selection**:\n- Choosing situations likely to produce desired emotions\n- Avoiding situations likely to produce undesired emotions\n- Examples: Choosing to spend time with supportive friends; avoiding conflict-prone situations\n\n**2. Situation Modification**:\n- Actively changing situation to alter emotional impact\n- Examples: Leaving party early; asking someone to stop annoying behavior\n\n**3. Attentional Deployment**:\n- Directing attention within situation\n- **Distraction**: Focusing away from emotional aspects\n- **Concentration/Rumination**: Focusing on emotional aspects\n- Examples: Looking away from upsetting scene; distracting oneself with music\n\n**4. Cognitive Change (Reappraisal)**:\n- Changing how one thinks about situation to alter emotional impact\n- Reinterpreting meaning of situation\n- Examples: 'She didn't mean to be rude'; 'This rejection is an opportunity'\n\n**5. Response Modulation**:\n- Altering emotional response after it has been generated\n- **Suppression**: Inhibiting emotional expression\n- **Other strategies**: Exercise, substances, relaxation\n\n**Reappraisal vs. Suppression**:\n\n**Reappraisal (Generally Adaptive)**:\n- Changes emotional experience, not just expression\n- Reduces negative emotion without cognitive cost\n- Does not impair memory\n- Associated with better well-being, relationships, social functioning\n\n**Suppression (Generally Less Effective)**:\n- Hides expression but emotional experience continues\n- Requires cognitive resources; impairs memory\n- Others detect inauthenticity; impairs social connection\n- Associated with worse well-being, more negative emotion long-term\n\n**Caveat**: Optimal strategy depends on context; suppression sometimes appropriate\n\n**Extended Process Model (2015)**:\n\nRegulation involves:\n- **Identification**: Recognizing need to regulate\n- **Selection**: Choosing strategy\n- **Implementation**: Executing strategy\n- **Monitoring**: Evaluating effectiveness\n\n**Emotion Dysregulation in Psychopathology**:\n\n- **Borderline Personality Disorder**: Intense emotional reactivity, poor regulation\n- **Depression**: Excessive rumination, ineffective regulation\n- **Anxiety Disorders**: Excessive avoidance, worry\n- **Substance Use**: Maladaptive regulation (substances to regulate emotion)\n\n**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** specifically targets emotion dysregulation.\n\n**Individual Differences**:\n\n**Emotional Intelligence (Mayer & Salovey)**:\n- Perceiving emotions\n- Using emotions to facilitate thought\n- Understanding emotions\n- Managing emotions\n\n**Affect Intensity**: How strongly emotions are experienced\n\n**Emotion Differentiation**: Ability to distinguish between specific emotions"
