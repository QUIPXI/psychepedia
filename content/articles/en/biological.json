          "**Historical Foundations**:",
          "The scientific study of brain-behavior relationships began in the 19th century with observations of patients with localized brain damage. **Paul Broca (1861)** described a patient who could understand language but could not speak—autopsy revealed damage to the left frontal lobe (now Broca's area). **Carl Wernicke (1874)** identified a region in the left temporal lobe critical for language comprehension (Wernicke's area).",

However, other researchers like **Karl Lashley** emphasized the brain's capacity for **equipotentiality** (distributed function) and **mass action** (overall amount of cortex matters for complex tasks).",
          "Modern neuropsychology recognizes that both localization and distributed processing are important: specific regions are specialized for particular functions, but these regions work together in networks to produce complex behavior.",

He suggested its use in psychiatry, where it was found to dramatically reduce psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.",
