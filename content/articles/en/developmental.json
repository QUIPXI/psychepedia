Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to 2 years)**:\n\n**Substages**:\n1. Reflexive activity (0-1 month)\n2. Primary circular reactions (1-4 months): Repeat actions involving own body\n3. Secondary circular reactions (4-8 months): Repeat actions on objects\n4. Coordination of secondary schemas (8-12 months): Intentional, goal-directed behavior\n5. Tertiary circular reactions (12-18 months): Experimentation\n6. Mental representation (18-24 months): Symbolic thought\n\n**Key Achievement: Object Permanence**:\n- Understanding that objects exist when out of sight\n- Develops gradually through substages\n- A-not-B error: Searching at previous location\n- Complete by 18-24 months\n\n**2. Preoperational Stage (2 to 7 years)**:\n\n**Achievements**:\n- Symbolic function: Language, pretend play, drawing\n- Rapid language development\n- Imagination and fantasy\n\n**Limitations**:\n\n**Egocentrism**: Inability to take another's perspective\n- Three-mountains task: Cannot describe what another sees\n- Not selfishness—genuine cognitive limitation\n\n**Centration**: Focus on one aspect of situation\n- Leads to errors in conservation tasks\n\n**Lack of Conservation**: Failure to understand quantity is unchanged by appearance\n- Liquid conservation: Tall thin glass vs. short wide glass\n- Number conservation: Spreading out a row of objects\n\n**Animism**: Attributing life to inanimate objects\n\n**Irreversibility**: Cannot mentally reverse operations\n\n**3. Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 years)**:\n\n**Achievements**:\n- **Conservation**: Understand quantity unchanged by appearance\n- **Classification**: Group objects by multiple criteria; class inclusion\n- **Seriation**: Order objects by dimension\n- **Decentration**: Consider multiple aspects\n- **Reversibility**: Mentally reverse operations\n- **Transitivity**: If A > B and B > C, then A > C\n\n**Limitation**: Operations limited to concrete, tangible objects\n\n**4. Formal Operational Stage (11+ years)**:\n\n**Achievements**:\n- **Abstract thinking**: Reason about hypothetical situations\n- **Hypothetical-deductive reasoning**: Form hypotheses and test systematically\n- **Propositional logic**: Evaluate logical validity independent of content\n- **Combinatorial thinking**: Consider all possible combinations\n- **Metacognition**: Think about thinking\n\n**Not all reach formal operations**: Education and experience influence development"
